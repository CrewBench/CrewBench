## Contributing

CrewBench is built in the open and contributions are welcome.  
Before writing code, please start with an issue so changes can be discussed and aligned with the project direction.

### How to Contribute

1. **Open an Issue First**
   - Describe the bug, feature request, or improvement
   - Provide context, use cases, and (if applicable) screenshots or logs
   - Label the issue appropriately (bug, enhancement, discussion)

2. **Fork the Repository**  
   Create your own fork to work on the change.

3. **Create a Feature Branch**

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

   ```

4. **Make Your Changes**
   - Keep changes focused and scoped to the issue
   - Follow existing code style and conventions
   - Add logs or comments where behavior may not be obvious

5. **Commit Your Changes**

   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat: describe your change clearly"
   ```

6. **Push to Your Fork**

   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

7. **Open a Pull Request**
   - Reference the related issue
   - Explain what changed and why
   - Include screenshots or demos if UI-related

### Contribution Guidelines

- Prefer small, reviewable pull requests
- Avoid introducing breaking changes without discussion
- Keep developer experience and observability in mind
- All code should respect CrewBench’s local-first and transparent design principles

Thank you for helping improve CrewBench.
